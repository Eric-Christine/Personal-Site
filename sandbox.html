    <h3>Limescale, Deposits, Mineral Buildup… Oh My!</h3>
    Hard water leaves behind stains that appear as a chalky, white residue.  You’ll often find these stains in the bathroom and kitchen on glass, porcelain, tile, and metal. These evaporated water stains are found in over 85% of households.
    <h3>What is Hard Water?</h3>
    Hard water is defined as the number of dissolved minerals present in the water. Hard water is high in dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium. When hard water is headed the calcium carbonate solidifies and leaves residue and deposits.
    <h3>Other Problems with Hard Water</h3>
    Hard water not only leaves behind stains, but it also can clog pipes, damage hair, cause skin irritation, wear out appliances, and much more.
    <h3>How to remove Hard Water Stains</h3>
    There are many options out there to work out that stubborn soap scum. Here are just a few:
    <ul>
        <li>
    <h4>Chemical Cleaners</h4>
    There are so many cleaning products on the shelves out there, but they can be harmful to your health and the environment. They also go down the drain and contaminate the water supply. Natural alternatives are listed below.</li>
         <li>
    <h4>Vinegar</h4>
    Pour white vinegar into a spray bottle and cover any surface with hard water stains. Let it sit for 5 to 15 minutes to give the vinegar time to break down the minerals. For large areas like shower doors, you’ll want to drench paper towels in vinegar and paste them to the glass surface.</li>
         <li>
    <h4>Fluoride Toothpaste</h4>
    Use fluoride toothpaste on small metal fixtures, glass surfaces, and dishware.</li>
         <li>
    <h4>Baking Soda</h4>
    Mix baking soda and water into a paste and apply to affected areas. Let sit and then scrub with a cleaning brush.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Prevent Hard Water Stains</h3>
    Preventing is much easier than fixing. If you want to do away with hard water for good, you’ll need to install a water softener.
    
    Kleenatap’s Whole House Magnetic System magnetizes the flowing fluid and disrupts the natural bonding of water molecules. Thus, altering the structure of the scale-forming minerals. Water regains its solvency and will not allow the minerals to form crystals or scale.
    
    This means a softer and safer household water supply.
