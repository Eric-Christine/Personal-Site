# Personal-Site
personal website

<h1>Welcome to my personal site</h1> 
<p> I wanted to create a simple way for potential employers to learn a little bit about me, see the work I've done, and find my social links/ resume</p>
<p> This site is created using raw HTML and CSS from scratch (no templates) </p>
