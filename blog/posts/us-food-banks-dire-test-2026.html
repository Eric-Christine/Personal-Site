      <h1>U.S. Food Banks Face Their Most Dire Test Yet</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        American food banks entered 2026 stretched to historic limits. Then demand stayed high while major funding
        channels tightened.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nearly 48 million Americans were in food-insecure households in 2024. Food banks adapted with stronger
        logistics, expanded partnerships, and tighter prioritization, but those gains now face new pressure as federal
        support shifts and household costs remain elevated.
      </p>

      <h2>What changed</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Demand remained elevated well above pre-2020 levels.</li>
        <li>More working households turned to assistance for the first time.</li>
        <li>Over $1.5B in support was reduced, delayed, or less predictable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why this is different from prior surges</h2>
      <p>
        Most emergency systems can handle short spikes. This situation is different because the spike became a long
        plateau. Food banks have been operating in emergency mode for years, with volunteer and staffing systems under
        sustained load.
      </p>

      <h2>Operational priorities that matter now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Shorter procurement cycles to reduce pricing volatility risk.</li>
        <li>Regional warehouse collaboration to balance inventory across markets.</li>
        <li>Data-led distribution planning to prioritize neighborhoods with the highest unmet need.</li>
        <li>Predictable private-sector partnerships to offset public funding swings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where support has the highest leverage</h2>
      <p>
        The most effective contributions are often flexible dollars, logistics support, and recurring local partnerships.
        In stressed systems, flexibility is what keeps shelves stocked and delivery routes running.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this decade is about resilience, food-bank resilience is now a core part of community resilience. The system
        can still perform, but only with consistent support and better long-term planning.
